According to the National Safety Council report, approximately 38,300 people were killed and about 4.4 million injured in the road accidents United States in 2015. There are a variety of reasons that contribute to accidents. Some of the reasons are adverse Weather and Traffic conditions that cause accident prone situations. Predicting likelihood of vehicular crashes due to the effect of Weather and Traffic features would be a major step towards achieving better road safety.
This paper attempts to create models that account for spatial and temporal features to determine likely vehicular crash conditions. It is expected that the findings from this paper would help civic authorities to take proactive actions on likely crash prone weather and traffic conditions. These models can also be distributed in form of an APIs and can be added as an additional safety layer on existing navigational applications for safer commutes.
